# Database
*Codecademy Portfolio Project for CS103*

Here is a summary of the project objectives. More details about each objective can be found in the Kanban board for this project:

- Research the topic of your choosing to create a entity relationship diagram for your database
- Create the schema of the database using PostgreSQL
- Populate your database with some data
- Update your database to ensure your data stays intact. This could include adding constraints and roles
- Update your database to ensure your database stays fast. This could include adding indexes, normalizing your database, and actively monitoring and maintaining your database.

For this project [PostgreSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally) will be used to create the database.

*Note: other Off-Platform Projects over the course of CS103 (specifically [“Designing A Database From Scratch”](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/computer-science/paths/cscj-22-databases/tracks/cscj-22-designing-relational-databases/modules/wdcp-22-creating-an-organized-database-04584a24-895f-47c1-859a-4c78874a15bb/informationals/off-platform-project-designing-a-database-from-scratch)), will likely already give you a database with some of the foundational elements already set up that can be used as a starting point.*
